MoneyMind ("we," "our," or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle user information when you use our app.

## 1. Information We Collect
We do not store or collect personal information. However, we use third-party services to facilitate authentication and financial data processing:

- **Firebase Authentication**: We use Firebase to authenticate users via email or third-party login methods.
- **Plaid (Sandbox Mode Only)**: MoneyMind **strictly** uses Plaid in **sandbox mode** to simulate financial data retrieval. **No real banking data is accessed, stored, or processed.** All financial data displayed within the app is purely for testing and simulation purposes.

## 2. How We Use Your Information
- Authentication is handled by **Google Firebase** to verify users.
- Financial data is **temporarily processed within the app** via **Plaid (sandbox mode only)** for simulation purposes.
- **No real financial data is collected, stored, or shared**.

---

## 3. Data Security
We use industry-standard security practices:
- **Firebase Authentication** ensures secure user login.
- **All data transmission is encrypted** using HTTPS.
- We **do not store user credentials, transaction history, or any real banking data**.

## 4. Third-Party Services
MoneyMind integrates third-party services, which have their own privacy policies:

- [Google Firebase Authentication Privacy Policy](https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy)

These services manage and process data on their platforms.
